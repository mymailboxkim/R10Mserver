Gwanghwamun=Gwanghwamun is the main gate of the main palace.\
	It has a double-roofed pavilion over three arched openings set in a high stone foundation. The king used the central arch, while the crown prince and officials entered through the openings on either side. The gate pavillion housed a bell, which announced the time of day.\
	The original gate had been moved to the north of Geonchunmun, the east gate of the palace, when the headquarters of the Japanese Government-General in Korea was built right behind Gwanghwamun in the 1920s. Bombed during the Korean War(1950-1953), the pavilion of the original gate was destroyed and the stone foundation was severely scarred. Gwanghwamun was rebuilt in 1968 as a concrete structure but restored to its original shape as a wooden and granite structure in 2010.\
	The fact that Gyeongbokgung is the Joseon Dynasty's main palace was evident by the style of its gates, including Gwanghwamun. Although the gates in other palaces stand on low steps, those of Gyeongbokgung are replicas of fortress gates, with high stone foundations and arched entrances in the center. Gwanghwamun is the most formal of these gates with three arched openings, a good indication that Gwanghwamun is the main gate of the main palace.\
	
Heungnyemun=The corridors extending out from Heungnyemun form an enclosure. In the middle of this enclosure is Geumcheon Stream, which was designed to flow through the palace from the west to the east after coming down from Mt. Baegak.\
	A bridge called Yeongjegyo is located at the center of this stream. A stream is a must in all Joseon royal palaces, including Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Gyeonghuigung and Deoksugung as well as Gyeongbokgung. There were also streams in the previous Goryeo Dynasty palaces and in Chinese and Vietnamese royal residences, indicating that a palace stream was a requisite for East Asian palaces. The palace stream and Yeongjegyo Bridge acted as a boundary that marked where the court officials stood during their regular audiences with the king.\
	
Geunjeongjeon=Geunjeongjeon is the Throne Hall, where the king granted audiences to his officials, presided over large official functions and met foreign envoys. Geunjeongjeon is the largest and most formal hall in Gyeongbokgung. The two-tier edifice stands on a high platform reached by stone steps. There is a spacious courtyard in front, where important events were held and corridors enclose it.\
	
Sajeongjeon=The Office Quarters were where the king handled state affairs and studied Chinese classics with his civil servants in normal times. The quarters were also where he threw parties for his relatives and ministers and supervised qualifying examinations for the civil service.\
	The Office Quarters in Gyeongbokgung are centered on Sajeongjeon Hall. Between Sajeongmun Gate, leading to the Throne Hall compound and Hyangomun Gate, opening to the living quarters, there are three buildings Sajeongjeon, Manchunjeon and Cheonchujeon facing south, enclosed by a corridor-like structure with compartments inside.\

Sujeongjeon=Sujeongjeon, located to the south of the pond with Gyeonghoeru Pavilion, was where Jiphyeonjeon(the Hall of Worthies) was situated during King Sejong's reign. It was rebuilt in King Gojong's reign when the palace was restored. The hall was used as the sleeping quarters in the early years of King Gojong's reign and doubled as his residential quarters. At the time of Gabo Reform in 1894, the Deliberative Council(Gunguk Gimucheo) and the cabinet were housed here.\

Gangnyengjeon=Fires burned down Gangnyeongjeon three times, including a fire during King Sejong's reign(1397-1450), which broke out while expanding the quarters and laying out the under-floor heating flues. It was restored when the palace was rebuilt in the late 19th century but was demolished in 1918 to supply wood to rebuild the burned-down living quarters in Changdeokgung Palace. The material was used to build Huijeongdang Hall in Changdeokgung Palace in 1920.\
	The current Gangnyeongjeon Hall was built in 1995. The arrangement of the rooms is characterized by Ondol(heated-floor) rooms on the left and right with a wide wooden-floor space in the middle and a wide stone veranda in front. Special festivities took place on this veranda. For large-scale feasts thrown by the king or the queen, temporary steps were installed to facilitate access for participants.\
	
Gyotaejeon=The arrangement of the rooms in Gyotaejeon, the queen's living quarters, is similar to the king's quarters. The only difference is that there is no stone veranda in front. The structures of the buildings are also the same ; no ridges decorate the top of the roofs, and inside are two parallel beams. There are various opinions about why there are no roof ridges, but no definitive reason has been found.\

Jagyeongjeon=Jagyeongjeon, located to the east of the living quarters, was built for the Dowager Jo, posthumously given the title of Queen Sinjeong. She was the adoptive mother of young King Gojong. Jagyeongjeon was built when Gyeongbokgung was rebuilt by the Daewongun, the ambitious father of King Gojong. The building burned down soon after it was built and the current structure was restored in 1888 (the 25th year of King Gojong). This hall is composed of two rooms with Ondol (heated) floors, Bogandang and Jagyeongjeon and a veranda, Cheongyeonnu, to the southwest. The east side of Cheongyeonnu is connected with another room called Hyeopgyeongdang. To the south of Jagyeongjeon Hall is a low building, with Mansemun Gate in the middle. Mansemun is a four-panel folding door designed to be opened and closed easily by the women.\

Jasundang=This compound was where the crown prince lived with the crown princess, while he was in training for the throne. The Crown Prince's Compound consisted of two main buildings Jaseondang and Bihyeongak along with a lecture hall for the prince(Chunbang) and the building for security(Gyebang). The Crown Prince's Compound was not built when Gyeongbokgung was first constructed but was added in 1427 during King Sejong's reign. While King Munjong(r. 1450-1452) was crown prince, his son, who became King Danjong(r. 1452-1455), was born in Jaseondang. After Gyeongbokgung was rebuilt in the late 19th century, King Sunjong(r. 1907-1910) lived there.\ 
	The current buildings were rebuilt in 1999 ; only Jaseondang and Bihyeongak have been restored. To the north of the compound was the royal kitchen.\

Gyeonhweru=Gyeonghoeru, a pavilion located on a pond to the west of the living quarters, was built as a venue for feasts for foreign envoys and for the king and his court officials.When Gyeongbokgung was constructed, a small pavilion was built there, but in 1412(the 12th year of King Taejong), the pond was enlarged and a pavilion of the current size was built. This pavilion tilted, so it was rebuilt during King Seongjong's reign(r. 1469-1494). At the time, the stone pillars were decorated with dragons and flowers. During Yeonsangun's reign(1494-1506), The hills called Mansesan were created on the other two smaller man-made islets decorated with artificial flowers. All those were burned down in a fire during the Japanese Invasions(1592-1598). Although the pavilion disappeared, kings would periodically officiate at rites to pray for rain at the pond until Gyeongbokgung was rebuilt in the late 19th century.\
	The current Gyeonghoeru Pavilion was built in 1867 (the fourth year of King Gojong). Other rebuilt structures in Gyeongbokgung were burned down at various times, but Gyeonghoeru Pavilion remained intact. A wall encircled the pond, but it was torn down during the Japanese occupation (1910-1945). The wall on the north and east side were restored in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Sculpted animals sit atop the front railing stones on three stone bridges leading to the pavilion ; this is to ward off evil spirits.\

Hyangwonjeong=In 1873, when King Gojong built Geoncheonggung, he had a pond dug to the south, with an islet created in the middle. A two-tier hexagonal pavilion, built on the islet, was named Hyangwonjeong and the wooden bridge leading to it was called Chwihyanggyo.\

Taiyuanjeon=To the northwest of Gyeongbokgung are various shrines, including Binjeon, Honjeon and Yeongjeon. Binjeon was where the caskets of the royal deceased were laid soon after their deaths. Honjeon was where their mortuary tablets were housed for two years until they were sent to Jongmyo, the Royal Ancestral Shrine. Yeongjeon displayed portraits of the deceased and rites were held in front of these images. Taewonjeon Shrine held the portrait of King Taejo, the founder of the Joseon Dynasty. Later, it was used for other purposes, such as housing mortuary tablets and performing rites for the deceased.\
	This quiet area is isolated from the other palace buildings. King Gojong(1852-1919) often went to Gongmukjae, a rite-preparation building adjacent to Taewonjeon, to meet his court officials. Taewonjeon was dismantled in the early 20th century and the current building is an exact replica of the old structure. Befitting a shrine, the building exudes a somber ambience.\

Gunchunggung=This residence was built in 1873(the 10th year of King Gojong), five years after Gyeongbokgung was rebuilt. Located in a secluded place in the northernmost part of the palace, it was built for the king and the queen to enjoy peace and quiet. A large pond called Hyangwonji was created nearby, with a pavilion at the center. The residence followed the architecture of a typical scholar's residence, except for a few ornate decorations. Jangandang Hall for the king, Gonnyeonghap Hall for the queen and Gwanmungak Library behind Jangandang are laid out to copy the men's quarters, women's quarters and the library of the typical literati's residence.The surrounding brick walls are decorated with beautiful flower patterns.\
	King Gojong liked the residence so much that he stayed there frequently with his queen. When the king and the queen did not reside in these quarters, portraits of preceding kings were housed there. In contrast to the intended purpose of relaxation, this residence was an arena of political turmoil toward the end of the Joseon Dynasty. This was where King Gojong received ministers from the United States, Great Britain and Russia to resolve a variety of political issues. During these years of upheaval, a Russian architect rebuilt Gwanmungak Library as a two-story brick edifice. The first electric lights in the palace were installed here. In 1895, a group of Japanese assassins raided this residence and slaughtered Queen Myeongseong, King Gojong's wife. She died in Okhoru, the high veranda of Gonnyeonghap.\
	
jipokjae=These three palace buildings(from left to right) are Parujeong, Jibokjae and Hyeopgildang. They were originally built in the precincts of Changdeokgung, but were moved to Gyeongbokgung in 1888 when King Gojong relocated his official residence there. King Gojong used the buildings as an art hall in which to enshrine royal portraits, a library and an audience hall for the reception of foreign envoys. Records show that in 1893 the king granted five audiences to foreign envoys from Great Britain, Japan and Austria.\
	The architectural style of Jibokjae differs significantly from that of other palace buildings, clearly displaying the influence of Chinese architecture, which at that time was regarded as \u201cmodern\u201d by Korean builders.\
